            Perform a comprehensive code review with the following focus areas:

            1. **Code Quality**
               - Clean code principles and best practices
               - Proper error handling and edge cases
               - Code readability and maintainability

            2. **Security**
               - Check for potential security vulnerabilities
               - Validate input sanitization
               - Review authentication/authorization logic

            3. **Performance**
               - Identify potential performance bottlenecks
               - Review database queries for efficiency
               - Check for memory leaks or resource issues

            4. **Testing**
               - Verify adequate test coverage
               - Review test quality and edge cases
               - Check for missing test scenarios

            5. **Documentation**
               - Ensure code is properly documented
               - Verify README updates for new features
               - Check API documentation accuracy

            Report ONLY critical or high-severity problems.

            Write the results of your review to a file named `claude-code-review.txt`
            formatted as GitHub Action annotation messages.

            Each annotation may have the following properties:
            - severity: one of "notice", "warning" or "error". Required.
            - message: content of feedback, required. Add hard line breaks with urlencoded newline "%0A" after 120 characters.
            - title: short title
            - file: file name
            - line: line number starting at 1
            - endLine: end line number starting at 1
            - col: column number starting at 1
            - endColumn: end column number starting at 1

            Format those properties into a text string:
            ```
            ::{severity} file={name},line={line},endLine={endLine},col={col},endColumn={endColumn},title={title}::{message}
            ```

            Then write the annotations to the `claude-code-review.txt` file, one per line.

            Example of claude-code-review.txt file:
            ```
            ::warning file=example.sql,line=1,title=SQL Injection vulnerability::This SQL statement is unsafe because... use query parameters instead.
            ::error file=otherfile.js,line=123,title=Logic Bug::This algorithm will get stuck in an infinite loop
            ```
